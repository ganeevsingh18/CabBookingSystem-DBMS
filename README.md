# DBMS Project – Cab Booking System  

A project developed as part of the **DBMS course (4th Semester)** with collaborator **Dhruv Garg (2021386)**.  

## Overview  
We designed and implemented a **Cab Booking System** to demonstrate core concepts of database design and management. The system models real-world cab operations including users, drivers, rides, and payments.  

## Key Features  
- **Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling** to capture system entities and their interactions.  
- **Relational schema design** translated from ER diagrams.  
- **SQL queries and operations** for booking, ride history, driver assignment, and payments.  
- **Normalization** applied to ensure efficiency and reduce redundancy.  

## Learning Outcomes  
- Applied **ER modeling and relational schema design** for a practical system.  
- Understood how to enforce **constraints, relationships, and transactions** in SQL.  
- Built a working prototype showcasing a real-world **DBMS application**.
